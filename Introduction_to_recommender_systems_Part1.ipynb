This fact is often illustrated by what is known as the \"long tail problem\" (represented in the figure above), where tracking user engagement with items in a large content repository sees a small number of these items receiving a disproportionate amount of attention, while the majority of items are unexplored. The truth is that a user simply doesn't know of each item which exists, nor has the time to inspect each item even if it were known. \n",

While this is something that we'll learn throughout this entire train, one fundamental principal that we need to understand is that recommender systems are built up by utilising the _relations_ which  exist between items and users. As such, these systems always need a mechanism to measure how related or _similar_ a user is to another user, or an item is to another item. \n",

We won't go into the fundamental trig here (we hope that you remember this from high school), but recall that as an angle becomes smaller (approaching $0^o$) the value of its cosine increases. Conversely, as the angle increases the cosine value decreases. It turns out that this behavior makes the cosine of the angle between two p-dimensional vectors desirable as a [similarity metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) which can easily be computed.\n",

Unfortunately, like other areas of machine learning, this strategy may be a bit too risky/expensive to let a poor recommendation system (or random recommendations!) be exposed to users. Instead, in a similar approach to other machine learning fields, we tend to make use of historical rating data collected from users to test our systems. Here, as we have seen before, we partition our historical rating data into train and test splits; using train data to help build and tune our recommendation algorithms, while test data are withheld in order to perform assessment.  \n",

Common examples of objective measures include: \n",

Besides the written contents inside this book (item), it has certain attributes or properties which further describe it - such as the author (\"Philip Pullman\"), genre (\"fantasy\"), or target audience (\"young adult\"). These properties are not unique to this novel, as other books also have authors, genres, target audiences, etc. As such, we can compare the properties of different books with the assumption that books which have properties in common (such as author or genre) are similar to one another. We can further **assume that individuals like similar items**. For our example, this means that Mpho, if using content-based filtering to recommend her next book, would have a book such as \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" suggested to her over Anne Frank's \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", as the former novel is far more 'similar' to The Golden Compass.     \n",

Following along from our example above, we're going to use the `tag_name` field for each book as a representation of properties such as genre, time-period, and target audience. We're also going to consider the `authors` field, as individuals often enjoy reading novels written by the same author. \n",

As such, books which share an author will be regarded as being far more similar.  \n",

We went on to review the content-based filtering method both theoretically and  practically through code implementation. \n",
